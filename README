First, move everything onto cluster using `setup_gibbs.sh` or `setup_wheeler.sh`
depending the desired cluster. This copies files into the shared /home/edlee
directory as well as specifies the max number of separate nodes to use to run
jobs.

You can run the model setup (since Intel and AMD pickles are serialized
differently) with `bash run_pickle.sh`.

Then, everything is automated through `bash run.sh ####`. It distributes files
to the nodes and submits the jobs to each cluster separately. It needs to be
given the name of the model pickle without the ".p" suffix.

`jobfile_template.sh` contains settings for using PBS and qsub.
`run.py` contains the code that is to be run.

The files are set up somewhat differently on the cluster. The shell program and
Python program are all copied into a single directory and the program is run
from there, whereas here there is a separate directory for automating the use of
clusters.
